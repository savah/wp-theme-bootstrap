# The Mozaik WordPress Theme Boilerplate

The goals of the boilerplate are to:

1. be a product used and produced by the entire team <br/> (suggestions, issues and pull requests are welcome and encouraged)
1. be easy to set up, use, understand and extend or modify
1. guide the development process to be consistent where it can be
1. offer a robust development and build workflow (currently powered by the cli and gulp)
1. make getting off the ground with a new project really fast

## Important Prerequisites

### Technical

1. Have [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system *(node@^0.12.2 && npm@^2.7.4)*
1. Have [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) globally installed *(gulp@^3.8.11)*

- *You can use [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage the node versions installed on your computer*
- *You can use [`npm-check-updates`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) to update the node modules in your theme (Note that updating may break things, so be careful)* 

### WordPress

1. Read [the WordPress theme development guidelines](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development)
1. Understand [the WordPress template hierarchy](http://codex.wordpress.org/images/9/96/wp-template-hierarchy.jpg)
1. Understand [the WordPress Loop](http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop)
1. Understand [how WordPress helps with Data Validation/Sanitization](http://codex.wordpress.org/Data_Validation)
1. Read up on the following WordPress core APIs:
	- [the Plugin API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API)
	- [the Shortcode API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API)
1. Understand when you should use a Custom Functionality Plugin instead of implementing functionality within a theme
 	- [Creating a custom functions plugin for end users](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2011/02/02/creating-a-custom-functions-plugin-for-end-users)
 	- [How to Create a Custom Functionality Plugin (And Why You Need One)](https://www.nutsandboltsmedia.com/how-to-create-a-custom-functionality-plugin-and-why-you-need-one/)
	
### JavaScript

1. Understand [modular JavaScript](http://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/)
1. This project uses [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) to provide support for modular JS, read up on the functionality & tools it provides

### CSS

1. The boilerplate assumes you are using SCSS to write your styles and compiles to CSS using [Libsass](http://libsass.org/)
1. [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) is used for adding the correct vendor prefixes to the final generated CSS

## Development Guidelines

- Avoid committing the built theme to the project repository
- Avoid committing the `wp-uploads` directory to the project repository
- Avoid making changes directly to the built theme -- Always use the build process
- In production avoid uploading the theme development directory to a public server
- It is good practice to enable `WP_DEBUG` in your `wp-config.php` file, *but only* during development

## Standard Theme Development Process

### Setup

1. Install WordPress and clear it of unnecessary default themes & plugins
1. Clone/Download the contents of this repository into a directory in your WordPress `wp-content/themes` directory (eg: "my-theme_dev") _this will be your "dev theme"_
1. Open the terminal and navigate to the dev theme, *eg:* `cd wp-content/themes/<my-theme>_dev`
1. (**Note:** The next steps **require** nodejs *@^0.12.2* and gulpjs *@^3.8.11*)
1. Run `npm install` to install all dev dependencies
1. Change the `package.json` with your new theme's configuration (specifically: name, prettyName, description, version, author, authorURI, license & keywords)
1. Run `gulp build` to generate the "built theme" for the first time
1. Log in to the admin and enable the *built theme*
	 (**Note:** The *dev theme* is not a valid theme, that's fine! Don't delete it or try to enable it!)
1. Start Developing!

### Development

1. Run `gulp` to begin the dev build process that uses libsass, browser-sync and webpack
1. Develop your theme in the `/assets` and `/theme` directories, *the "built theme" will be generated by gulp*
1. Optional stuff:
	- use `npm install --save <module(s)>` to easily manage js dependencies, then use `var <module> = require('<module>');`
	  or `import <module> from '<module>';` anywhere in your js files you want to use them
	- explore the `/library` directory in the dev theme for anything useful to your project. If you find anything
	  copy it into your `/theme` folder somewhere under `/theme/includes`, modify it as you require and include it where you need it

### Production

1. Delete files you are not using from inside the `/theme` directory
1. [Add a screenshot.png](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Screenshot)
1. Before deploying run `gulp build` to generate a production ready version of the built theme
1. Deploy the built theme directory, *not the dev directory*

## Reading Recommendations

1. [WordPress Developer Documentation](http://codex.wordpress.org/Developer_Documentation)
1. We generally follow the [WordPress PHP Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/php/) in our WP code
1. The build process supports the [<abbr title="EcmaScript 6">ES6</abbr> JavaScript syntax](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es6/) by using [babel.js](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile ES6
   to ES5.
   
## FAQ

### 1. How do I use jQuery with wp-theme-bootstrap ?

As mentioned above, wp-theme-bootstrap uses [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) to handle concatenating, minifying and optimizing the javascript in the theme.
Webpack, like Browserify and RequireJS, is a module loader for javascript and as such requires each module (file) to declare the dependencies it has within it. 
To use jQuery, or any other global library, in your webpack-ed js you have a couple of choices:

- Use jQuery as a dependency for all modules in the project and include it in the final concatenated package (Recommended):
	1. With the terminal open _within the dev theme_, type `npm install jquery --save` to install jquery for the project
	1. In the `./gulp/core/config/scripts.js` file add this line to the top of the file to expose webpack within this file:
	
			var webpack = require('gulp-webpack').webpack;
	    
	1. Then within the file declare that any instance of `$`,`jQuery` or `window.jQuery` within the project refers
	   to the jQuery package we downloaded earlier. We can achieve this by adding the following to the `plugins` 
	   section of your webpack config:
	   
			...
			plugins: [
				...
				new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
					'$' : 'jquery',
					'jQuery': 'jquery',
					'window.jQuery': 'jquery'
				}),
			],
			...

- Use jQuery as an external package:
	1. Declare jQuery as an external dependency of your `main.js` in the `wp_enqueue_script` function in your `functions.php` file.
	   Something like this:
	   
			wp_enqueue_script( 'main', "$theme_dir/assets/js/main.js", array( 'jquery' ), null, true );
			
	1. Declare jQuery as an external dependency in webpack. Add the following to `./gulp/config/scripts.js` in the webpack section of
		 the config:
	
			...
			externals: {
				jquery: 'window.jQuery'
			}
			...
